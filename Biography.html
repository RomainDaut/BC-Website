Let’s keep it simple because, after all, it’s all about the music, right?
<br>
The BC crew started in 2012 as a heavy rock/doom trio created by <strong>Romain Daut</strong> , with <strong>Sammy Deveille</strong> on bass and <strong>Zacharie Mizzi</strong> behind the drums.
“Now, that was quite some time ago, but the way I remember it, we just showed up with our instruments at a house party, took some LSD, and started jamming, for 4 hours. 1 week later we were all together again working on the first EP. 4 years later we listened to a recording of that jam, it was horrible.”
<br>
<p>They got lucky enough to get help from their peers when they set up a kickstarter campaign to finance the EP recording. JB Pilon, an old friend, co-produced it at Rock of London Studio, Brad Boatright mastered it at Audiosiege (US) and it got released on Bilocation Records (GER) that same year. It was on!</p>
<p>In 2013 they got offered an opening slot on a tour with “Trippy Wicked” (UK) and “Wight” (GER) all over the Her Majesty’s United Kingdom. That first tour was followed by another one in Europe 4 months later with a remarkable stop at the Up in Smoke festival, where they played with Pentagram, Truckfighters, My Sleeping Karma and many more.</p>
<p>Then started what we could call “The Bassist Void.” First, Sammy left, then JB replaced joined for a while, then they had a brief run with Barnaby from “Messengers” (UK), and Jack Boughton, all great bass players! Until they found Maximilian Ternebring in 2014, wonderful heavy rock bass player, Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath fan, now playing in “The Riven” (SW). They recorded two tracks, “Shaman/Fear The Lord,” co-produced with Emil Lloyd at Unit 2 Studios in Feb 2015, mastered by Tony Read at HeavyHead Recording Co and released digitally in March the same year. April that year was their first co-headline tour, with their brothers from Elephant Tree, all over Europe.</p>
<p>“We had the best time, we were unstoppable, until we got too drunk to actually stand, then we had to stop... For a while, at least. #putstuffonpete it was us.” The end of 2015 saw the recording of “Before The Shore,” Bright Curse’s first album, with Zach on drums and Max on bass, again with JB co-producing at Rock of London Studio, and Mastered by Jaime Gomez Arellano at Orgone (UK).</p>
<p>The album was critically acclaimed and two headlining tours followed. They played DunaJam, Hellfest, Desertfest Berlin and Keep it Low festivals, and prestigious venues like L’Usine in Geneva or The Void in Bordeaux, shared the stage with huge acts like Radio Moscow, Color Haze, Salem’s Pot, Red Fang, Kvelertak and many more.
2017 was marked by the comeback of Sammy “The Jammy” on bass and 2 new members, the excellent Mark Buckwell on drums and long-time friend Tommy Foster on lead guitar for the recording of the latest album, “Time of The Healer,” during the summer 2018.
“I wanted to get back to our roots with this one, a lot of jams, it’s not as fast and punchy as Before the Shore. I incorporated some new instruments, Peruvian flute, double bass etc. But I don’t want to
spoil the surprise..." We had all grown up musically since 2012, and I needed to put some of that in there, but not change everything. Bright Curse will still be Bright Curse. I think this album is going to surprise a lot of people, hopefully in a good way.”
They kept the original recording team for this one, with JB Pilon as co-producer in his brand new Buffalo Studio (UK) and Brad Boatright at Audiosiege (USA)
They signed on Ripple music in November 2018, the album is to be released in April 2019.</p>
